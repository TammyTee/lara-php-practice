# Laravel and PHP Practice

This repository was created to continue to learn and practice new and existing features of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/). [Practice branches](https://github.com/TammyTee/lara-php-practice/branches) may also cover concepts like data optimization, code automation, etc.

## Navigating This Repo

Each feature I intend to work on has it's own dedicated branch where I've outlined specific areas of growth I will work on for that feature.

I'll also document any resources I found helpful for studying each feature and a summary of the practice scenario, in case others visiting this repo find them useful.

Please visit the [branch overview page](https://github.com/TammyTee/lara-php-practice/branches) to see an overview of all practice concepts and features in this repo. To keep things organized, a breakdown of each practice scenario for each feature branch will be maintained in individual pull requests for review.
